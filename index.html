    <h3 >Rules:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Watch and Repeat:</strong> Simon will display a sequence of colored lights and sounds. Pay close attention to the order in which the colors appear.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat Correctly:</strong> After Simon's sequence, it's your turn to replicate the same sequence by pressing the corresponding colored buttons. Tap the buttons in the same order as Simon's sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Progression:</strong> If you repeat the sequence correctly, Simon will add a new color to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging. Keep track of each color as the sequence grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Mistakes End the Game:</strong> Make a mistake by pressing the wrong color or pressing them out of order, and the game ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Yourself:</strong> Test your memory and concentration as you strive to beat your previous high score by remembering longer and more complex sequences. Let's see how far you can go!</li>
    </ol>
